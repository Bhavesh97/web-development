*What is GIT?*

Git is a version control system, probably like **Central Versioning System or Revision Control System** but much more powerful and features.
For example, if you have a file on which youâ€™ve been working on and reworking for a long time, all the versions of it are saved in Git, and you can easily get back to every version. 
Let's take example - You're cooking dish and suddenly you add more salt than needed, similarly in case of programs/code/software there will we mistakes or errors so to rectify that we use GIT. Git also allows many different person to work on same code.
